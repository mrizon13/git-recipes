        </p>

        <p>
            This is a savory noodle dish with a hint of sweetness and lemony tang. It is made with thin rice noodles, egg noodles, chicken, carrots, snow peas, cabbage, and/or green beans. Traditionally, calamansi is used for a zesty addition but lemon or lime is a good substiute if you cannot find any. Let's dive into how to make it!
